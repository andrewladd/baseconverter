baseconverter
=============

Will convert number of x base to number of y base. 



At the moment, it only goes from base 10 to base any base less than 10. 

Will convert to utilize IOSkeleton. 

Plan to:
- First allow to go from x e[2,10] base to y e(2,10) base.
- Then from base ten to bases x e[11,16]. 
- Then repeat step 1 for bases up to 16. 
- Then beyond.
